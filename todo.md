#  To Do

##  Bugs

* deleting a currently playing recording from the edit menu or with the delete key will not stop playback
* playback sometimes stops due to a weird error

##. Features

* add other playbakc controls like pause, skip back, skip forward, speed, etc (might need now playing screen)
* syncing data with CoreData and CloudKit
* ability to assign recording to a date other than creation date (i.e. allow assignment of calendarDate property)
* maybe recording detail view
* Calendar view to see all days for which there are recordings
* Today view
* understand the weird messages being written to the console
* editing/trimming functions
